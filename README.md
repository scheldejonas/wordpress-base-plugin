# Wordpress Plugin

Search and replace the files with "plugin_name".

Replace it with the "slug" you want for the plugin.

Rename the plugin folder to the slug with dashes instead of underscores.

Copy the folder with sftp to the plugins path in your wordpress.

Or compress the folder to a .zip, and upload it with Wordpress Admin
